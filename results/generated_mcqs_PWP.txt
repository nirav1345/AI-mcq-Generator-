Let me create 5 MCQs covering different units:

1. From Unit I - Python features
2. From Unit II - Operators
3. From Unit III - Data structures
4. From Unit IV - Functions/scope
5. From Unit VI - Exception handling

I need to make sure each question has 4 options and clearly indicates the correct answer.
