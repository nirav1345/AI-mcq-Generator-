The user wants me to generate 6 multiple-choice questions (MCQs) based on the given text about Mobile Application Development (MAD - 22617). I need to create questions that cover different units and topics from the provided syllabus.

Looking at the search results, I can see various Android-related MCQs and answers which can help me understand the typical format and topics that are commonly asked.

Let me analyze the text and create questions from different units:

Unit I: Android and its tools
- Introduction to Android, Open handset alliance, Android Ecosystem
- Need of Android, Features Of Android
- Tools and software required
- Android Architecture

Unit II: Installation and Configuration
- Operating System, Java JDK, Android SDK
- Android Development Tools(ADT)
- Android Virtual Devices(AVDs)
- Emulators
- Dalvik Virtual Machine, Difference between JVM and DVM
- Android Studio and SDK installation

Unit III: UI Components and Layouts
- Control Flow, Directory Structure
- Components of a screen, Fundamental UI Design
- Different layouts: Linear, Absolute, Frame, Table, Relative

Unit IV: Designing User Interface With View
- Various UI components like TextView, EditText, Button, etc.
- ListView, GridView, ImageView, etc.
- Time and Date Picker

Unit V: Activity and Multimedia with Database
- Intent, Intent_Filter
- Activity Lifecycle, Broadcast Lifecycle
- Content Provider, Fragments
- Service features and lifecycle
- Android System Architecture, Multimedia
- Audio, Camera, Bluetooth, Animation
- SQLite Database

Unit VI: Security and Application Deployment
- SMS Telephony
- Location Based Services
- Android Security Model
- Application Deployment, Google Play Store

Let me create 6 MCQs covering different units:

1. Unit I - Android Architecture/Features
2. Unit II - Dalvik Virtual Machine
3. Unit III - Layouts
4. Unit IV - UI Components


5. I'll focus on creating MCQs for the Activity Lifecycle and Services from Unit V
6. I'll develop a question related to Application Deployment from Unit VI

I'll draw insights from key Android development concepts like the activity lifecycle, service types, and deployment processes to craft precise and challenging multiple-choice questions that test understanding of core Android development principles.
